    <h1 class="text-center">About This Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a demonstration of an ASP.NET Core web application that showcases various concepts and technologies in modern web development. The primary goal of this project is to create a dynamic web application that displays a list of games using JSON data.</p>
    <p>Key Features of the Project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>ASP.NET Core MVC: Utilizing the MVC design pattern for structuring the application.</li>
        <li>Razor Pages: Creating dynamic web pages with Razor syntax and C# code-behind.</li>
        <li>JSON Data Source: Reading game data from a JSON file for simplicity and ease of management.</li>
        <li>Bootstrap: Using the Bootstrap framework for responsive and visually appealing UI.</li>
        <li>C# Language: Writing the server-side logic using C# language.</li>
        <li>Visual Studio 2022: Developing the project using Visual Studio Community Edition.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With this project, we aim to demonstrate the seamless integration of ASP.NET Core, Razor Pages, and JSON data to create a user-friendly web application. The application allows users to view a curated list of games, including details such as the title, platform, genre, and release date.</p>
    <p>We believe this project serves as a valuable learning resource for anyone interested in web development using ASP.NET Core and related technologies. By examining the code and exploring the functionality, developers can gain insights into building data-driven web applications with a modern and efficient stack.</p>
