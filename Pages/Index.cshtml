        <h1 class="display-4 text-center">Welcome to Your Game List Project</h1>
        <p class="lead text-center">This is a demonstration of an ASP.NET Core web application that uses a JSON data source to display a list of games. The project showcases the use of ASP.NET Core MVC, Razor Pages, and JSON Web API.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <p>ASP.NET Core is a powerful and cross-platform framework for building modern web applications. In this project, we leverage the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to structure the application, providing clear separation of concerns between data, presentation, and logic.</p>
        <p>Razor Pages, a part of ASP.NET Core MVC, allow us to create dynamic and data-driven web pages with the help of Razor syntax, which combines C# code seamlessly with HTML markup.</p>
        <p>The application reads game data from a JSON file, which acts as a lightweight and easy-to-manage data source. The JSON data is then deserialized into a list of GameModel objects, representing each game's details.</p>
        <p>These games are presented on the Game List page, which utilizes Bootstrap, a popular front-end framework, to create responsive and visually appealing game cards. Each card displays the game's title, platform, genre, and release date along with an associated cover image.</p>
